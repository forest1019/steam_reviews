The chilled music and laid back atmosphere allows for a wholesome and charming experience with just a tad of nostalgia, but just as I was thinking there’s more to the game than expected, it ended.  There isn’t much of a story or emotional investment to unpack and there isn’t much character development beyond “growing up”. The pixel art graphics are good except when you zoom in and the pastel art style compliments the theme.  Although it wasn’t clear what all the items were supposed to be, they are very detailed and there are lots of neat little touches to enjoy.  It’s a short but solid game which is easy enough to complete due to the limited scope and challenge, but the music was quiet for too long at stretches and a lot of the bonus content like camera filters and achievements are easily missed.\t\t\t']",0,0,0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976408337/,Substancer,,0,ENGLISH
